              their target audience. Here are a few key points to consider when
              it comes to the importance of social media marketing: Increased

              customer engagement: Social media platforms provide businesses
              with the opportunity to interact directly with their customers.{" "}

              build stronger relationships with their audience and improve
              customer satisfaction. Cost-effective: Compared to traditional
              marketing methods, social media marketing is relatively
              inexpensive. Businesses can reach a large audience without
